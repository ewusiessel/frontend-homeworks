Start from your previous Spotify Exercise.
The goal of this exercise is to fetch data from the API instead of having them "wired up" in the page.

Generate automatically 3 lists based on the "search API" response

Load them during page load, and create the collections based on the API response.
Make the central part of the page scrollable both horizontally and vertically
Add a "List albums" button. When pressed, he should create and display a list of albums on the page
Add a "Count Unique" button. When pressed, he should log the number of unique albums on the page
