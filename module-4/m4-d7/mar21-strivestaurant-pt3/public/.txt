Strivestaurant
1. Transform DishComments functional component into a class based one.
2. In the ReservationForm component make the Form actually visible just after clicking on the h2 above it (use the component state!).
3. Change MyNavBar component in a class-based one; create a constructor and log a message in the console as the component initializes.
4. In the DishComments component use the ternary operator to show a piece of text instead of the ListGroup if the dish prop is a falsy value.
5. In the Home component, hide the DishComments component with a short-circuit operator if the selected dish name is "Amatriciana".
6. In the Home component, show an Alert component instead of the ReservationForm if even a single a comment of the selected dish has a rating below 5.
7. In Home.jsx give a "header" prop to the Reservations component. If present, this component should display it instead of the generic 'RESERVATIONS' in its h3.
8. In the Home component use a ternary operator to replace the text inside the h1 and the p tags above the carousel with the values of the props "newTitle" and "newPayoff" respectively, if present.
9. Change the "Strive for food" text in the MyNavBar component to "The perfect place for pasta lovers" if the prop title has a value of "Strivestaurant".
