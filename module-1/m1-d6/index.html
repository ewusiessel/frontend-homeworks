        <td>Apple, fruit of the domesticated tree Malus domestica (family Rosaceae), one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits.

When harvested, apples are usually roundish, 5–10 cm (2–4 inches) in diameter, and some shade of red, green, or yellow in colour; they vary in size, shape, and acidity depending on the variety.</td>
